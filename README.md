- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @heynatebanjo
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to code.  Let's see if I can figure any of this out.  Not sure the point of this site exactly.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a high school teacher, minimal coding experience here from college time.  Pretty much starting from zero. Where to start?
- ğŸ“« How to reach me? - by messaging me here?
